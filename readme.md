## Summary of Findings

> 
Working on the data we started specifing the some filters to extract our data by finding the top 5 Stations that the users go for and tidy it in to a separate dataframe to conclude the most repeatitive values to explore this current dataset.
Age-durtaion relation and how the age of the user affect the duration of usage,User type-duration relation and that most of the users are customers
We started investigating more in the times of the trips so we can identify wahat is the most preferred time for users and our investigation focused three main points:

the relation with weekdays on each station
the relation with the most crowded hours in each station
the relation with the most crowded hours in the age range of 28 to 38
